# Healthcare-Assistant
The healthcare industry is constantly concerned with illness diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. India's population is increasing so quickly that, particularly in this COVID condition, many are unable to schedule appointments or travel for diagnoses. The creation of a virtual assistant was a practical technological solution to the problem.


A virtual assistant is a program which can understand human speech and act 
accordingly. So, in our scenario we developed a virtual assistant to diagnose diseases or illness in 
people with the help of machine learning. The concept of tress was used which gave appropriate 
results when specific parameters were encountered. The user gave his symptoms as an input with 
the help of python’s speech to text library. We also developed an appointment booking system 
within the assistant to book appointment with the top-rated doctors on Google, for booking an 
appointment the body part which had problems was asked by the assistant than as soon as the 
email was specified. An email regarding the appointment was sent to the user’s email box 
Python’s smtplib library was used to send email. Thus, our objectives were achieved. 

# Requiremnets
1. Python for the entire development cycle-Version 3.9 
2. Python’s libraries **pyaduio**, **speech_recognition**, **pyttsx3** for input and output. 
3. A phpMyAdmin database to manage patient records and appointments. 
4. smtplib Mailing to receive notifications. 
5. Gathering data from the internet regarding symptoms and respective diseases

# Conclusion
The implementation of a virtual assistant to identify disease and book appointments can play a 
key role in the near future. Recognizing disease to a considerable rate is being one step closer of 
removing serious life conditions like death at an exceedingly early stage. Altogether the assistant 
developed for the project strives in the most efficient way to bring a change.
